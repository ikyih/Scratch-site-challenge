# Scratch-site-challenge
Challenge I made about making a website entirely in scratch (or Turbowarp)

**Rules**
1. The site must be made entirely in scratch (or turbowarp).
2. extenstions are allowed (including custom turbowarp extentions as long as they are not being made specifically for the challenge).

   Turbowarp is reccomended

**making it into a website**
  1. download the project as a .sb3.
  2. open TurboWarp Packager at https://packager.turbowarp.org (do this even if you made your project in original scratch).
  3. upload your .sb3 file.
  4. press load project.
  5. in player options turn on "Start project automatically instead of showing a big green flag".
  6. then change your environment to zip.
  7. Press package.
  8. Wait a second or two and the zip file should download.
  9. Open the zip.
  10. index.html and all the other files should be there.
  11. you're done! now you could use whatever web hosting service you prefer.
